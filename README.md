Keyword Extractor using OpenAI ChatGPT with React and Chakra UI

The Keyword Extractor project utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT model and integrates it into a web application built with React and Chakra UI. This application enables users to extract keywords from text with a focus on importance and frequency.

The core of the project relies on the OpenAI ChatGPT model, a powerful language model that can understand and generate human-like text. Leveraging the OpenAI API, the Keyword Extractor communicates with ChatGPT to analyze input text and identify significant keywords.

The front-end interface is developed using React and Chakra UI, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Users input their text, triggering a request to the ChatGPT model through the OpenAI API. The model processes the text, extracting keywords based on their importance and frequency, and returns the results to the front-end.

The extracted keywords are then sorted in descending order of importance or frequency, allowing users to easily comprehend and utilize the most relevant keywords. Customization options are available, enabling users to fine-tune the extraction process according to their preferences.

The integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT model with React and Chakra UI creates a seamless and efficient keyword extraction tool. With this application, users can gain valuable insights from text, aiding tasks such as content analysis, SEO optimization, and research.

In summary, the Keyword Extractor project combines the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT model with the user-friendly interfaces provided by React and Chakra UI. This integration empowers users to extract keywords efficiently and effectively, facilitating various applications requiring keyword analysis.
